### Certified Fire Walking Instructor

The experience of fire walking is one that people will never forget. It empowers individuals and is a great team-building exercise for corporate events.

In 2012, I was certified as a Fire Walking Instructor through the Firewalking Center, which is one of the most experienced schools in the world. This school features Tolly Burkan, the father of the fire walking movement in the United States. To find out more, visit the schoolâ€™s website at http://www.thefirewalkingcenter.com/

Fire walking demonstrates how our thoughts impact everything else in our lives. Thoughts change brain chemistry, which changes our body chemistry and leads to changes in our lives. When you are walking over the coals, you must pay close attention to your thoughts since that will determine if you are going to have a positive experience or not. It is an example of extreme spirituality, a moving meditation, and a life-changing experience. It empowers people to achieve their goals.

If you would like more information, please contact me. You can also schedule a fire walking event. Please note there are also break-through activities available in addition to fire walking, such as board breaking, arrow breaking, and walking on broken glass.

### Energy Seeing Class

Have you ever wanted to learn how to see energy? Well, you can.

In this class, we will learn to play with our ability to perceive energy with all of our senses, but mostly focusing on our ability to see energy. Using our connection to nature and remembering what we knew as children, I will take you on an adventure to reclaim your senses to experience the energy world around us.

You will never experience the world the same way after this class. The world reveals so much more when we pay attention to it and what surrounds us. Seeing and perceiving energy empowers us to live more fully and be more aware of what is around us. Come play with us, awaken your imagination and exploration of what lies around us everyday.

### Reiki Classes

I have a master-level Reiki certification. I have taken Reiki from two different instructors, and I have found that it varies widely with who teaches it. I continue to learn as much as I can so I may bring it to my clients and students.

If you are interested in Reiki classes, please contact me.
