I have a master-level Reiki certification. I have taken Reiki from two different instructors, and I have found that it varies widely with who teaches it. I continue to learn as much as I can so I may bring it to my clients.

I usually combine both Quantum Touch and Reiki during my session so that my clients get the benefits of both. It is a powerful combination which super charges your experience. Both are hands-on energy healing. Both move stuck energy so that your body can heal and de-stress. Most clients who are used to Reiki treatments find that both are much more powerful together. I am also able to see energy and help you move it better through your body and activate your own gifts.
