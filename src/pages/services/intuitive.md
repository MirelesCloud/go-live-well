My mission is to help other sensitives empower themselves and develop the tools they need to succeed and thrive in their lives. Your sessions with me will help you to heal and guide your decisions toward what is in your best interests.

I have always been intuitive, even as a child. I remember realizing I could read people when I was very young. I am an intuitive and an empath. It was challenging during my early years because I was so sensitive, but I have learned tools to help grow and balance my abilities.

Love is what connects us and is the vehicle of healing. People need to be held, witnessed, and acknowledged, which is what my sessions are about. I grew up a Christian, and I connect to Christ Consciousness and angels during my sessions. I use that unconditional God love space to hold you, see your energy and intuit what is going for you from a neutral perspective.

Some of the issues we can work on together include:
-  cord cutting to negative people
-  healing addictions
-  relationship issues
-  career path
-  growth periods
-  removing blocks
-  manifesting
-  grief
-  emotional issues

I am able to see where the energy is stuck in your body, and I empower people to be able to do the same for themselves. Intuition can bring you insights about your own health and wellbeing. My goal is to get you well as soon as possible so you can learn how to heal and balance yourself â€“ and maybe even help others.
